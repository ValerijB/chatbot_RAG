Before you head off on your trip Lithuania‚Äôs charming capital of Vilnius, it‚Äôs helpful to be aware of a few key details that will make your trip more enjoyable and stress-free.

From the best time to visit to navigating the city‚Äôs public transport, here are the essential things you need to know before heading to Vilnius.

1. How to get around Vilnius?
Vilnius is relatively easy to navigate, thanks to its compact size and well-structured public transport system. Here‚Äôs what to expect:

Public Transport
Vilnius has an efficient bus and trolleybus system. Tickets can be purchased via mobile apps or at kiosks. Public transport is affordable and reliable, with frequent service throughout the city and to the suburbs.

Walking
The city centre is walkable, with many attractions located within a short distance from each other. The Old Town‚Äôs cobblestone streets are ideal for a stroll, though comfortable shoes would be recommended.

Cycling
Vilnius is becoming more bike-friendly, with bike lanes in some parts of the city. You can rent bikes or use the city‚Äôs bike-sharing service, CycloCity.

For most people, walking and public transport will be a convenient way to get around Vilnius. If you plan to explore the surrounding countryside, consider renting a car for greater convenience.

Do you need to hire a car in Vilnius?
Whether or not you need to rent a car in Vilnius depends largely on your travel plans and how much of Lithuania you intend to explore. Here‚Äôs what you should consider:

Pros of renting a car in Vilnius:
Flexibility: Renting a car gives you the freedom to explore beyond Vilnius at your own pace. The city itself is very walkable, but a car is useful if you plan to visit nearby attractions like Trakai Castle or the Hill of Crosses.
Day Trips: Lithuania has several charming towns and natural parks within driving distance of Vilnius. With a car, you can easily access these sites without relying on tour schedules.
Cons of renting a car in Vilnius:
City Traffic: Like any other city, Vilnius can get congested, especially during peak hours. Parking in the city centre can also be challenging and often requires a fee.
Public Transport: The city has an excellent public transport system, including buses and trolleybuses, making it easy to get around without a car.
If your plan is to stay mainly within Vilnius or take guided tours to nearby sites, you likely won‚Äôt need a car. However, if you prefer to venture out on your own, renting a car offers flexibility and convenience.
